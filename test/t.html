        <p>Organic products are much fresher than regular, conventional products. The reason for that is that non-organic products are infused with preservatives that make them last longer. But organic produce 
          doesn’t have any of that, which means it’s fresher. So, that’s one of the best benefits of eating an organic diet.</p>

        Organic farms use less energy, they pollute the environment a lot less than conventional farms, they conserve water more, increase soil fertility, and reduce soil erosion. Farms that use synthetic pesticides can cause damage to people living nearby, 
        as well as to birds and animals, so organic farms are safer for everyone, since they don’t use any pesticides.
        <p>What does “organic” mean?



          The term “organic” refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed. While the regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic crops must be grown without the use of synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers, or bioengineered genes (GMOs).
          
          Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must be raised in living conditions
           accommodating their natural behaviors (such as the ability to graze on pasture) and fed organic 
           feed and forage. They may not be given antibiotics, growth hormones, or any animal by-products.

Organic foods are produced using farming methods which do not involve applying pesticides or chemical fertilizers. They are not created using manufacturing solvents, chemical additives, or irradiation. Organic foods of animal origin, such as dairy products and meats, come from animals that are usually free range, or allowed to roam outdoors. Free range animals have organic foods to eat and they are not given any form of steroids as they are growing. This mean that people will not get the effects of those hormones in their food. Beef is a common food for people to consume. The cows that are free range will produce organic milk and cheese free of hormones. Free range chickens offer organic meat as well as eggs.
